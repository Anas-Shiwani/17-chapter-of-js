    <h1>Welcome to the JAVASCRIPT Session:</h1>
    <h2>Here we can practice some chapters of <b>JAVASCRIPT</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Alert</a></li>
        <br><br>
        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Variable For String</a></li>
        <p>A variable is created when you write var (for variable) followed by the name that you
            choose to give it. It takes on a particular value when you assign the value to it. This is a
            JavaScript statement that creates the variable name and assigns the value "anas" to it. <br>
            The name anas that are covered in ""this are called string. <b>For Example</b> <br>
            var name = "anas"; <br> console.log (name); <br>If you check the answer go to the console.</p>
        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Variable For Numbers</a></li>
        <p>A string isn't the only thing you can assign to a variable. You can also assign a number. <br>var weight =
            45; <br>Having coded the statement above, whenever you write weight in your code, JavaScript
            knows you mean 150. You can use this variable in math calculations.
            If you ask JavaScript to add 5 to weight... <br>weight + 5 <br>If you check the answer go to the console.
        </p>
        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Variable Names Legal and Illegal</a></li>
        <p>Here are the rest of the rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A variable name can't contain any spaces.</li>
            <li>A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.</li>
            <li>Though a variable name can't be any of JavaScript's keywords, it can contain keywords.
                For example, "userAlert" and "myVar" are legal.</li>
            <li>Capital letters are fine, but be careful. Variable names are case sensitive. A "rose" is not a
                "Rose". If you assign the string Floribundas to the variable "rose", and then ask JavaScript
                for the value assigned to "Rose", you'll come up empty.</li>
            <li>I teach the camelCase naming convention. Why "camelCase"? Because there is a hump or
                two (or three) in the middle if the name is formed by more than one word. A camelCase
                name begins in lower case. If there's more than one word in the name, each subsequent
                word gets an initial cap, creating a hump. If you form a variable name with only one
                word, like response, there's no hump. It's a camel that's out of food. Please adopt the
                camelCase convention. It'll make your variable names more readable, and you'll be less
                likely to get variable names mixed up.</li> <br> <b>Examples:</b> <br> userResponse <br>userResponseTime
            <br>userResponseTimeLimit <br>response
        </ul>
        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Math expressions:
                <br> Familiar operators</a></li>
        <p>Wherever you can use a number, you can use a math expression. <br>The arithmetic operators I've been using,
            +, -, *, and /, are undoubtedly familiar to you.
            This one may not be: <b>For Example</b> <br>var num = 10;<br>
            var anotherNum = 1;<br>
            var popularNumber = num + anotherNum; <br>If you check the answer go to the console.</p>
        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Math expressions: <br>
                Unfamiliar operators</a></li>
        <p>There are several specialized math expressions you need to know. Here's the first one. <br> num++; <br>You
            decrement using minuses instead of pluses. <br>num--; <br>we have two types of increament and dexreament:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post increament</li>
            <p>In post increament we used to write the increament afterwards. <b>For Example </b> <br>a++ </p>
            <p>if a = 10 and b = a++ and console this situation the answer of b is 10,but the value of a is 11.</p>
            <li>Pre increament</li>
            <p>In Pre increament we used to write the increament backwards. <b>For Example </b> <br>++a</p>
            <p>if a = 10 and b = ++a and console this situation the answer of b is 11 and the value of a is also 11.</p>

            <li>Post decreament</li>
            <p>In post decreament we used to write the decreament afterwards. <b>For Example </b> <br>a-- </p>
            <p>if a = 10 and b = a-- and console this situation the answer of b is 10,but the value of a is 9.</p>
            <li>Pre decreament</li>
            <p>In Pre decreament we used to write the decreament backwards. <b>For Example </b> <br>--a</p>
            <p>if a = 10 and b = --a and console this situation the answer of b is 9 and the value of a is also 9.</p>

        </ul>

        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Math expressions: <br>
                Eliminating ambiguity</a></li>
        <p>Complex arithmetic expressions can pose a problem, one that you may remember from
            high school algebra.This is totally based on airthamtic rules are known as BODMAS RULES.In this case first
            we solve the bracket then division , then multliplication , and additio and subtraction. <br>Here are the
            example to clear your doubts.</p>
        <p>var a =10; <br>var b = 20; <br>var c = 30;<br> var d = 1 + (a/b*c); <br>so what the answer ? <br>If you want
            to know the answer check out the console page. <b><i>The answer of given situation is 16.</i></b></p>

        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank"> Concatenating text strings:</a></li>
        <p>In Chapter 1 you learned to display a message in an alert,But suppose you wanted to personalize a message. In
            another part of your code you've
            asked the user for her name and assigned the name that she entered to a variable, userName.
            (You don't know how to do this yet. You'll learn how in a subsequent chapter.)
            Now, you want to combine her name with a standard "Thanks" to produce an alert that
            says, for example, "Thanks, anas!"
            <br> <b>The second alert showing the Concatenating text strings</b>
        </p>

        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank"> Prompts:</a></li>
        <p><i>A prompt box asks the user for some information and provides a response field for her
                answer.</i> <br>Prompt code is like alert code, with two differences.
        <ul>
            <li>In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. That means you need to start
                by declaring a variable, followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>In a prompt, you can specify a second string. This is the default response that appears in
                the field when the prompt displays. If the user leaves the default response as-is and just
                clicks OK, the default response is assigned to the variable. It's up to you whether you
                include a default response.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank"> if statement:</a></li>
        <p>Suppose you code a prompt that asks, "Where does the Pope live?"
            If the user answers correctly, you display an alert congratulating him. <br>var x = prompt("Where does the
            Pope live?");<br>
            if (x === "Vatican") {<br>
            alert("Correct!");<br>
            }</p>
        <p>The example of this case first ever you seen the prompt where i can ask you a question <br><b>do you have a
                cnic card ?</b><br>if your answer is yes so the alert is run and allowed you to enter and if your answer
            is no so the case end here.</p>
        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank"> Comparison operators:</a></li>
        <p>Let's talk a little more about ===. It's a type of comparison operator, specifically an
            equality operator. As you learned in the last chapter, you use it to compare two things to see if
            they're equal.
            <br>You can use the equality operator to compare a variable with a string, a variable with a
            number, a variable with a math expression, or a variable with a variable. And you can use it to
            compare various combinations. <br>Like ===, string comparisons using the not-equal operator are
            case-sensitive. It's true that
            "Rose" !== "rose".
        </p>
        <p>Here are 4 more comparison operators, usually used to compare numbers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>> is greater than</li>
            <li>
                < is less than</li>
            <li>>= is greater than or equal to</li>
            <li>
                <= is less than or equal to</li>
                    <ul>
                        <p>In the examples below, all the conditions are true.</p>
                        <li>if (1 > 0) {</li>
                        <li>if (0 < 1) {</li>
                        <li>if (1 >= 0) {</li>
                        <li>if (1 >= 1) {</li>
                        <li>if (0 <= 1) {</li>
                        <li>if (1 <= 1) {</li>
                    </ul>
        </ul>

        <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank"> if...else and else if statements:</a></li>
        <p>The if statements you've coded so far have been all-or-nothing. If the condition tested
            true, something happened. If the condition tested false, nothing happened. <br>
            if (x === "Vatican") {<br>
            alert("Correct!");<br>
            } <br>
            else {<br>
            alert("Wrong answer");<br>
            }</p>
        <p>you already saw that the program run in alert in the form of if else and else if if you enter the karachi
            then program gives you a msg and if u enter the wrong city then also prpgram gives you a msg simoltaneously
            working on the town program.</p>
        <p>The answer of city = karachi and town = lyari</p>
